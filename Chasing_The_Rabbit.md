Learnings:
Describes methods for how to improve processes when operating complex systems from car manufacture to medical care. Suggests 4 critical capabilities:
1) Design processes using all available knowledge with tests to reveal failure early. Example - Toyota's first product was a loom that stopped when a thread broke.
2) Swarm problems as soon as they appear. Your knowledge will have been incomplete and when something different to your expectations (usually bad but even if it is good!) swarm it immediately! By doing this you learn how to improve your process and what gaps you have in your knowledge.
3) Spread that knowledge. Once one sector learns something new make sure you have a way to spread it throughout your organization. That way everyone benefits from collective knowledge. Example - the Navy has extensive documentation/checklists about how to operate nuclear reactors so a new crew has access to the last 50 years of accumulated knowledge.
4) Leaders lead by developing those previous 3 capabilities in employees. Example - When Toyota encounters inefficiencies on their factory floor they don't bring in specialists to solve them, an experienced engineer/manager leads the workers in a scientific process to work out how to improve the situation. This is slower in the short term, but improves the average skill level in therefore performance in the long term.

A quick summary of these might be: It is impossible to design complex systems from first principles/best practices. So, do the best that you can but then aggressively improve as you observe places for improvement and incorporate those improvements into future designs. The job of leaders is to teach other to observe and test improvements.

For my work capability 2 seems most applicable. There are occasions when I ignore little annoyances in my workflow or gaps in my knowledge. If I swarmed them when they came up I would maybe learn more deeply, get more done more easily. There is a balance though: there is an example of a nurse in an inefficient surgery who can't immediately try fix all inefficiencies - they wouldn't get anything done that day! But by devoting a small amount of time each day to run down the back log the surgery eventually improves (in terms of patients/staff/hour).
Acceptance of small, unexplained problems is presented as the root of a number of failures (Three Mile Island, Shuttle Crashes). While these small problems didn't immediately result in catastrophe when combined with other apparently small problems/coincidences, or when by chance a slightly larger manifestation of the root cause appeared, they did.
I think the danger of multiple small issues is important. Consider something like [this 18m Google outage](https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/compute/16007?post-mortem) which was caused by a race condition + a bug + a bug in the thing that would have caught the initial bug. I wonder how many of those had been seen before but because they didn't all happen at once and so there was no customer impact they were ignored.

Capability 4 is also interesting. There is an example given where multiple groups of 3 each containing one experienced member and two inexperienced members try to complete some tasks. Most groups divided up the tasks between members - this sounds sensible and efficient - but this meant that the inexperienced members didn't learn much and only 1/3 of the work was done well. One group paired throughout with the experienced member helping the others find the solutions. It takes a bit longer but all tasks were completed well and the two inexperienced members learned more so in future they can work independently and well. Advocating more paired work?

The book also advocates lightweight testing rather than just theorizing. "Bolt rather than weld, tape rather than bolt, hold rather than tape" is Toyota's saying to advocate doing the simplest test that will answer the question. When testing it is important to not just test e.g. "Does the material hold up to the stresses" but to test your best current knowledge "The material should hold up to X impact". Any result other than this shows a gap in your knowledge that can be filled whereas the former teaches you much less.

Another potential problem is having different groups manage subproblems and no-one in charge of the whole. E.g. no one doctor knows all about your care, in a advertising company the conversation is bumped from customer/sales/design/accounts/etc with no-one ever being quite sure exactly where in the pipeline anything is. While there needs to be specialization there needs to be a clear flow of information, an understanding of who needs to do what at each step and when that step is complete.
