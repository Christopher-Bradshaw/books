Learnings:

Part I

You cannot judge an action by its results but only by the expectation of its results given what you knew at the time. E.g. Play Russian Roulette for $10M - you can't say it was a good decision just because you won. Jugde an action by something that looks like the integral of P(outcome) * E(outcome) or the expected utility - sum over possible futures! This gets harder when the probabilities of the futures are hard (or impossible!) to know. How do you know your [investing strategy, climate policy, foreign policy, company strategy] doesn't have some small probability of blowing up in your face?

Nice annecdote - you flip a coin with a friend to determine who pays for dinner. You win, he pays. Do you thank him for paying, or do you not, knowing that you both payed equally.

Predicting the past is easy. Because we know what happened it is easy to point to the events that caused it and then wonder how the people didn't realise what was happening at the time. However before what happened happened (think of a wavefunction collapsing) there was a range of possible outcomes and we can't know exactly what would happen beforehand.

What is new is often noise. I completely agree in e.g. news but am troubled by the implications in my science life - most papers on the arxiv today are probably noise (will not be important 10 years from now). But, in some cases is there value in this "noise" (I hope so or why am I reading the arxiv)? Maybe if we don't think of it as news but probes - most will fail but one will make progress. However, that still suggests that unless you absolutely need to you should ignore it until you know which one will pay off. Age is value - you have to know the old things (GR). Learning the new things (pick alternative theory of gravity of your choice) is likely to be a waste of time unless it is right and you get a bit payoff.

Noise is a net negative. The constant random swings can lead to emotional burn out especially with loss aversion (imagine someone checking their portfolio every 10 mins. It will be down ~half the time but they will come out net unhappy!). Maybe an explanation for why people think things are getting worse Even it things are slowly getting better noise + loss aversion = new negative.

How do you know when a temporary downturn is temporary?

Part II (and general Biases)
* We don't learn nearly as much from history (or possibly reading books and taking careful notes on them!) as we do from personal experience.
* Survivorship bias - we think new things are important because we only list the important ones.
* Loss aversion - losing X hurts more than gaining X.


Quotes:
* "A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of the imformation until that point."
* What a journalist should say: "Today the market with up, but this information is not too relevant as it emnates mostly from noise"
